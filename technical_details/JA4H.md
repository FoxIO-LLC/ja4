# JA4H: HTTP Client Fingerprint

![JA4H](https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4/blob/main/technical_details/JA4H.png)

JA4H fingerprints the HTTP Client. Each client will have multiple fingerprints depending on what it’s doing. Clients will have different fingerprints when doing different HTTP Methods as well as different HTTP versions and will sometimes need to add fields depending on what the server tells it. However, the fingerprint will generally be the same per client per HTTP method and version save for cookie details. 

Each session is likely to have multiple JA4H’s, so each will be logged.

(2 character http method)  
(2 character http version)  
(“c” if cookie exists, “n” if no cookie or new connection)  
(“r” if referer exists, “n” if no referer or new connection)  
(2 character number of headers)  
(4 character first accept-language code)  
_  
(12 character truncated sha256 hash of the http header fields, in the order they are seen)  
_  
(12 character truncated sha256 hash of the cookie fields, sorted)  
_  
(12 character truncated sha256 hash of the cookie fields+values, sorted)  
```
Example JA4H: ge20cr13enus_a82fbf14bc42_457935509480_e97928733c74
```
2 Character HTTP Method:  
These are the HTTP methods available and their 2 character code to start the fingerprint:  
```
ge = GET  
he = HEAD  
op = OPTIONS  
tr = TRACE  
de = DELETE  
pu = PUT  
po = POST  
pa = PATCH  
co = CONNECT
```

2 Character HTTP Version:  
HTTP versions:  
```
10 = HTTP/1.0  
11 = HTTP/1.1  
20 = HTTP/2  
30 = HTTP/3  
```
If there is a Cookie in the HTTP header, the value is “c” for cookie.  
If there is not a Cookie in the HTTP header, the value is “n” for “n”o cookie or “n”ew connection

If there is a Referer in the HTTP header, the value is “r” for referer.  
If there is not a Referer in the HTTP header, the value is “n” for “n”o referer or “n”ew connection

2 character number of header fields. See below on capturing header fields. This ignores the cookie and referer header as that is captured above.  
06 = 6 headers  
99 = anything > than 100 headers

First 4 characters of the primary Accept-Language (ignore “-”):  
See https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry  
This field can look like:  
```
Accept-Language: da, en-GB;q=0.8, en;q=0.7  
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
```
The first value prior to the comma is the primary language of the client. JA4H captures this while ignoring the “-” character. Use 0s if less than 4 characters are used or if no accept-language field exists.

Example:  
```
da = da00  
en-US = enus  
en-UK = enuk  
ru-RU = ruru  
None = 0000
```

“_”

12 character truncated sha256 hash of the http headers:  
The http headers come after the http version code and start on new lines ending at a “:” JA4H captures all HTTP header fields, case-sensitive, but does not capture “Cookie” or “Referer” as as we’ve already captured them in the _a_ section of the fingerprint. These values are omitted so that the same application would have the same _b_ section of the fingerprint regardless of if it were a new connection or not. The fields are then concatenated with a “,” delimiter and sha256 hashed using the first 12 characters of the hash. 

So for:   
```
POST /plugins/unassigned.devices/UnassignedDevices.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Content-Length: 664
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.5735.110 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Origin: http://192.168.1.1
Referer: http://192.168.1.1/Main
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: example=d7df2dd0937ec27; ud_reload=UD_reload
Connection: close
```
The headers captured are:
```
Host,Content-Length,Accept,X-Requested-With,User-Agent,Content-Type,Origin,Accept-Encoding,Accept-Language,Connection
```
(notice “Cookie” and “Referer” is omitted)
Sha256 hash:
```
47d05ed57293244a9b505865f749705e4e7fcbfee3780254b075f46433e51251
```
Truncated hash:
```
47d05ed57293
```

“_”

12 character truncated sha256 hash of the cookie fields, sorted:  
The cookie fields are the values before “=” and are delimited by “;”. JA4H captures these fields and concatenates them using a “,” delimiter and then performs a truncated sha256 hash of the string.

Example Cookie:
```
Cookie: 1P_JAR=2023-06-07-17; AEC=AUEFqZdaLLwaXJHyxA8-Cu0i0N4klp_vV3XOuyEYeiWlp4QaeIvSv6t4XKM; OGPC=19027681-1:; NID=511=rRELE2o91XNLo6eayqEN7Lf2ue7EcSHVkew3oxf4jzyF8vix2BzxTRvda8MYBFEkLyC1xjTcqSIjbC-wV2r120jr2HFau_dHvMxUm9fk6W2J2mddtlMpGMA8qGuAZWt1DSpCFFwHZSKBryGnvRJUeXkc-jw4sXdWhgCKxeu3f01Na4YsBYGf; DV=A84BtBIPqhgmIDlq9acmfs7ik-duiZjdmUPDG3eW3QIAAAA
```
Fields captured:
```
1P_JAR,AEC,OGPC,NID,DV
```
Sorted in alphabetical order:
```
1P_JAR,AEC,DV,NID,OGPC = 21864220ae3d
```

12 character truncated sha256 hash of the cookie fields+values, sorted:  
The cookie fields+values are now captured and sorted like above, using a “,” delimiter and then performing a truncated hash. This part of the fingerprint will be unique to each user but can allow for tracking of individual users through the application without the need to log SPII like username or session tokens.

Using the example above, we sort the cookie to:  
```
1P_JAR=2023-06-07-17,AEC=AUEFqZdaLLwaXJHyxA8-Cu0i0N4klp_vV3XOuyEYeiWlp4QaeIvSv6t4XKM,DV=A84BtBIPqhgmIDlq9acmfs7ik-duiZjdmUPDG3eW3QIAAAA,NID=511=rRELE2o91XNLo6eayqEN7Lf2ue7EcSHVkew3oxf4jzyF8vix2BzxTRvda8MYBFEkLyC1xjTcqSIjbC-wV2r120jr2HFau_dHvMxUm9fk6W2J2mddtlMpGMA8qGuAZWt1DSpCFFwHZSKBryGnvRJUeXkc-jw4sXdWhgCKxeu3f01Na4YsBYGf,OGPC=19027681-1:

## Raw Output
The program should allow for raw outputs either sorted or original.  
-r (raw fingerprint) -o (original)

The raw fingerprint for JA4H would look like this:
```
JA4H_r = ge20cr13enus_Host,Sec-Ch-Ua,Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile,User-Agent,Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform,Accept,Sec-Fetch-Site,Sec-Fetch-Mode,Sec-Fetch-Dest,Accept-Encoding,Accept-Language_FastAB,_dd_s,countryCode,geoData,sato,stateCode,umto,usprivacy_FastAB=0=6859,1=8174,2=4183,3=3319,4=3917,5=2557,6=4259,7=6070,8=0804,9=6453,10=1942,11=4435,12=4143,13=9445,14=6957,15=8682,16=1885,17=1825,18=3760,19=0929,_dd_s=logs=1&id=b5c2d770-eaba-4847-8202-390c4552ff9a&created=1686159462724&expire=1686160422726,countryCode=US,geoData=purcellville|VA|20132|US|NA|-400|broadband|39.160|-77.700|511,sato=1,stateCode=VA,umto=1,usprivacy=1---
```

The "o" option includes the original values in the original order. This means Cookie and Referer are now included in the _b_ section of the fingerprint if present.

The raw fingerprint with original (-o) would look like this:
```
JA4H_ro = ge20cr13enus_Host,Cookie,Sec-Ch-Ua,Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile,User-Agent,Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform,Accept,Sec-Fetch-Site,Sec-Fetch-Mode,Sec-Fetch-Dest,Referer,Accept-Encoding,Accept-Language_FastAB,sato,countryCode,stateCode,geoData,usprivacy,umto,_dd_s_FastAB=0=6859,1=8174,2=4183,3=3319,4=3917,5=2557,6=4259,7=6070,8=0804,9=6453,10=1942,11=4435,12=4143,13=9445,14=6957,15=8682,16=1885,17=1825,18=3760,19=0929,sato=1,countryCode=US,stateCode=VA,geoData=purcellville|VA|20132|US|NA|-400|broadband|39.160|-77.700|511,usprivacy=1—,umto=1,_dd_s=logs=1&id=b5c2d770-eaba-4847-8202-390c4552ff9a&created=1686159462724&expire=1686160422726
```
