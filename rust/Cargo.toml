# [https://insta.rs/docs/quickstart/#optional-faster-runs]

# `insta` benefits from being compiled in release mode, even as dev dependency.
# It will compile slightly slower once, but use less memory, have faster diffs
# and just generally be more fun to use. To achieve that, opt `insta` and `similar`
# (the diffing library) into higher optimization:
