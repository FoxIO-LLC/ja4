# JA4+ Network Fingerprinting <!-- omit from toc -->

JA4+ is a suite of network fingerprinting methods by [FoxIO](https://foxio.io/) that are easy to use and easy to share. These methods are both human and machine readable to facilitate more effective threat-hunting and analysis. The use-cases for these fingerprints include scanning for threat actors, malware detection, session hijacking prevention, compliance automation, location tracking, DDoS detection, grouping of threat actors, reverse shell detection, and many more.

## Plugins

[Wireshark](https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4/tree/main/wireshark)  
[Zeek](https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4/tree/main/zeek)  
[Arkime](https://arkime.com/settings#ja4plus)

## Binaries

JA4 binaries are built from the [Rust implementation](rust/README.md) of the suite. To ensure full functionality, `tshark` (version 4.0.6 or later) is required. Download the latest JA4 binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4/releases) page. The release versions for the Rust implementation follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and are marked as `vX.Y.Z`, unlike Wireshark plugin releases.

### Release Assets

JA4 binaries are provided as compressed archives named according to the target platform, following a pattern like:

```txt
ja4-vX.Y.Z-<architecture>-<platform>.tar.gz
```

For example, `ja4-v0.18.5-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz` for Linux or `ja4-v0.18.5-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` for macOS ARM64. Choose the appropriate file for your system.

### Installing tshark

#### Linux

Install it using your package manager (the name of the package `tshark` or `wireshark-cli` depends on the distribution). For example, on Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install tshark
```

#### macOS

1. [Download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) and install Wireshark (includes `tshark`).
2. Add `tshark` to your `PATH`:
   ```sh
   sudo ln -s /Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS/tshark /usr/local/bin/tshark
   ```

#### Windows

1. [Download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) and install Wireshark (includes `tshark.exe`).
2. Locate `tshark.exe` (usually in `C:\Program Files\Wireshark\tshark.exe`).
3. Add the folder containing `tshark.exe` to your system `PATH`:
   - Open **System Properties** > **Environment Variables** > **Edit Path**.

### Running JA4+

Once `tshark` and the JA4+ binaries are available, run JA4+ using the following command:

- On Linux and macOS:
  ```sh
  ./ja4 [options] [pcap]
  ```
- On Windows, open **Command Prompt** and run:
  ```cmd
  ja4 [options] [pcap]
  ```

For more details on running JA4+ and its advanced configurations, refer to the [Rust implementation README](rust/README.md), which provides information on its features, usage scenarios, and customization options.

## Database

The official JA4+ database of fingerprints, associated applications and recommended detection logic is here: [ja4db.com](https://ja4db.com/)  
This database is under very active development. Expect orders of magnitude more fingerprint combinations and data over the next few months.

A sample [ja4plus-mapping.csv](./ja4plus-mapping.csv) is also available for quick reference.

## JA4+ Details

JA4+ is a set of simple yet powerful network fingerprints for multiple protocols that are both human and machine readable, facilitating improved threat-hunting and security analysis. If you are unfamiliar with network fingerprinting, I encourage you to read my blogs releasing JA3 [here](https://medium.com/salesforce-engineering/tls-fingerprinting-with-ja3-and-ja3s-247362855967), JARM [here](https://medium.com/salesforce-engineering/easily-identify-malicious-servers-on-the-internet-with-jarm-e095edac525a), and this excellent blog by Fastly on the [State of TLS Fingerprinting](https://www.fastly.com/blog/the-state-of-tls-fingerprinting-whats-working-what-isnt-and-whats-next) which outlines the history of the aforementioned along with their problems. JA4+ brings dedicated support, keeping the methods up-to-date as the industry changes.

All JA4+ fingerprints have an a_b_c format, delimiting the different sections that make up the fingerprint. This allows for hunting and detection utilizing just ab or ac or c only. If one wanted to just do analysis on incoming cookies into their app, they would look at JA4H_c only. This new locality-preserving format facilitates deeper and richer analysis while remaining simple, easy to use, and allowing for extensibility.

For example, GreyNoise is an internet listener that identifies internet scanners and is implementing JA4+ into their product. They have an actor who scans the internet with a constantly changing single TLS cipher. This generates a massive amount of completely different JA3 fingerprints but with JA4, only the b part of the JA4 fingerprint changes, parts a and c remain the same. As such, GreyNoise can track the actor by looking at the JA4_ac fingerprint (joining a+c, dropping b).

For a list of JA4+ methods and their descriptions, see [Current methods and implementation details](#current-methods-and-implementation-details).

To understand how to read JA4+ fingerprints, see [Technical Details](./technical_details/README.md).

## Licensing

*JA4: TLS Client Fingerprinting* is [open-source, BSD 3-Clause](./LICENSE-JA4), same as JA3. FoxIO does not have patent claims and is not planning to pursue patent coverage for JA4 TLS Client Fingerprinting. This allows any company or tool currently utilizing JA3 to immediately upgrade to JA4 without delay.

**JA4S, JA4L, JA4LS, JA4H, JA4X, JA4SSH, JA4T, JA4TS, JA4TScan and all future additions, (collectively referred to as JA4+)** are licensed under the [FoxIO License 1.1](./LICENSE). This license is permissive for most use cases, including for academic and internal business purposes, but is not permissive for monetization. If, for example, a company would like to use JA4+ internally to help secure their own company, that is permitted. If, for example, a vendor would like to sell JA4+ fingerprinting as part of their product offering, they would need to request an OEM license from us.

All JA4+ methods are patent pending.  
JA4+ is a trademark of FoxIO

JA4+ can and is being implemented into open source tools, see the [License FAQ](./License%20FAQ.md) for details.

This licensing allows us to provide JA4+ to the world in a way that is open and immediately usable, but also provides us with a way to fund continued support, research into new methods, and the development of the JA4+ Database. We want everyone to have the ability to utilize JA4+ and are happy to work with vendors and open source projects to help make that happen.

## Q&A

Q: Why are you sorting the ciphers? Doesn’t the ordering matter?  
A: It does but in our research we’ve found that applications and libraries choose a unique cipher list more than unique ordering. This also reduces the effectiveness of “cipher stunting,” a tactic of randomizing cipher ordering to prevent JA3 detection.

Q: Why are you sorting the extensions?  
A: Earlier in 2023, Google [updated Chromium](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5124606246518784) browsers to randomize their extension ordering. Much like cipher stunting, this was a tactic to prevent JA3 detection and “make the TLS ecosystem more robust to changes.” Google was worried server implementers would assume the Chrome fingerprint would never change and end up building logic around it, which would cause issues whenever Google went to update Chrome.

So I want to make this clear: JA4 fingerprints will change as application TLS libraries are updated, about once a year. Do not assume fingerprints will remain constant in an environment where applications are updated. In any case, sorting the extensions gets around this and adding in Signature Algorithms preserves uniqueness.

Q: Doesn't TLS 1.3 make fingerprinting TLS clients harder?  
A: No, it makes it easier! Since TLS 1.3, clients have had a much larger set of extensions and even though TLS1.3 only supports a few ciphers, browsers and applications still support many more.
